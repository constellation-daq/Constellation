    /**
     * @brief Measurement queue class which allows to queue and fetch measurement configurations which can be used to
     * reconfigure a constellation
     *
     * The measurement queue holds a reference to the currently used controller of the constellation and can take over when
     * the global state is ORBIT, i.e. all satellites have been initialized and launched, It will only take care of
     * reconfiguring, starting and stopping, and will leave the constellation in the ORBIT state when finishing.
     *
     * Each measurement consists of a set parameters for any number of satellites. The original values of the measurement
     * parameters are read from the satellites using the `get_config` command before each measurement and are cached in the
     * queue. WHenever a parameter does not appear in the measurement anymore, it is reset to the original value the next
     * time a reconfiguration is performed.
     *
     * For example, a queue that first scans the parameter `a` with values from `1 - 2` and the parameter `b` from `5 - 7`
     * will first read the parameter `a` from the satellite configuration, then set `a = 1` and `a = 2` in the subsequent
     * measurement. The next measurement will set `b = 5`, but parameter `a` does not appear anymore and is reset to its
     * original value read from the satellite.

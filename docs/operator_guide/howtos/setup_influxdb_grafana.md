# Setting up InfluxDB and Grafana

Online monitoring with [telemetry](../concepts/telemetry.md) is essential for most data taking operations.
This monitoring data can be nicely displayed in a browser with [Grafana](https://grafana.com/oss/grafana/) in combination
with a time series database like [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/).

## Setting up Docker Compose

The easiest way to set up InfluxDB and Grafana is with Docker Compose. Installation instructions for Docker and the Docker
Compose plugin can be found [on the Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). Alternatively, since Docker is
not trivial to set up and requires root, `podman-docker` together with `podman-compose` can be used instead if available in
the distribution repositories.

A file named `docker-compose.yaml` needs to be created with the following content:

```yaml
services:
  influxdb:
    image: docker.io/library/influxdb:2
    container_name: influxdb
    ports:
      - "8086:8086"
    volumes:
      - influxdb-config:/etc/influxdb2
      - influxdb-data:/var/lib/influxdb2

  grafana:
    image: docker.io/grafana/grafana-oss
    container_name: grafana
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - influxdb
    volumes:
      - grafana-storage:/var/lib/grafana

volumes:
  influxdb-config:
  influxdb-data:
  grafana-storage:
```

Then the containers can be started with:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

The containers can be stopped with:

```sh
docker compose down
```

## Setting up InfluxDB

InfluxDB can be accessed via [`http://localhost:8086`](http://localhost:8086).
When first visiting the website, a page for setup appears:

```{figure} influxdb_setup.png
InfluxDB setup page
```

Here, "constellation" as should be chosen as the initial bucket name.
After clicking "Continue", a page with an API key appears. The API key should be copied for use in the `Influx` satellite,
then the configuration can be finalized by clicking "Configure Later".

````{tip}
It is recommended to setup a maximum duration for which monitoring data is stored.
This can be done by going to "Load Data" → "Buckets", and then opening the settings for the "constellation" bucket.

```{figure} influxdb_bucket.png
InfluxDB bucket settings
```
````

Finally, it is recommended to create a custom API token for Grafana, that only reads from the "constellation" bucket.
This can be done by going to "Load Data" → "API Token", and clicking "Generate API Token" → "Custom API Token".

```{figure} influxdb_api_key.png
InfluxDB custom API token settings
```


## Setting up Grafana

Grafana can be accessed via [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).
The default username and password are both `admin`.

First, InfluxDB needs to be added as a data source. This can be done by clicking on "Connections" → "Data sources" and then
"Add data source". On the page InfluxDB can be selected:

```{figure} grafana_add_influxdb.png
Grafana add data source
```

On the configuration page, the following settings need to be adjusted:

- `Query language`: `Flux`
- `URL`: `http://influxdb:8086`
- `Organization`: InfluxDB organization name
- `Token`: Custom API token created for Grafana
- `Default Bucket`: `constellation`
- `Min time interval`: `1s`

```{figure} grafana_setup_influxdb.png
Grafana InfluxDB settings
```

## Adding a Dashboard

To add a dashboard, monitoring data needs to be available. The [`Influx` satellite](../../satellites/Influx) can be used to
add monitoring data to InfluxDB. It requires the InfluxDB organization name and the API key shown during the setup phase.

### Generating Monitoring Data

For testing, the `Mariner` satellite can be used in combination with the `Influx` satellite.

The `Mariner` satellite can be started with:

```sh
SatelliteMariner -g edda -n Nine
```

The `Influx` satellite can be started with:

```sh
SatelliteInflux -g edda -n DB
```

The satellites need to be configured. A sample configuration might look like this:

```toml
[Mariner.Nine]
voltage = 1.0
current = 1.0
sample_period = 5.0

[Influx.DB]
org = "Insert organization name here"
token = "Insert read-write API token here"
```

Assuming the configuration is stored in `config.toml`, the CLI controller can be started with:

```sh
Controller -g edda -c config.toml
```

The satellites can be initialized with the configuration using:

```python
constellation.initialize(cfg)
```

Now, the `Mariner` should send a `BRIGHTNESS` metric to the `Influx` satellite, which forwards it to the database.

### Creating a Query

To add a visualization in the dashboard, a Flux query needs to be made to the database. The easiest way to do this is using
the InfluxDB Data Explorer. There, the bucket (`constellation`), the measurement (sending satellite) and the filed (metric)
can be chosen. On the right, the aggregate function should be set to "last" and then the query can be submitted.

```{figure} influxdb_query_builder.png
InfluxDB Query Builder
```

The Flux query can be copied by switching to the "Script Editor":

```{figure} influxdb_query_script.png
InfluxDB Script Editor
```


Monitoring data can also be transformed in the Query for example to change the units.
To multiply a value by `0.01`, this can be added in front of the `yield` part of the query:

```text
  |> map(fn: (r) => ({ r with _value: r._value * 0.01 }))
```

In this particular case with the `Mariner` satellite, this wouldn't work since `_value` is an integer, which needs to be
transformed to a float first with `float(v: r._value)`. The final query would then be:

```text
from(bucket: "constellation")
  |> range(start: v.timeRangeStart, stop: v.timeRangeStop)
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r["_measurement"] == "Mariner.Nine")
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r["_field"] == "BRIGHTNESS")
  |> aggregateWindow(every: v.windowPeriod, fn: last, createEmpty: false)
  |> map(fn: (r) => ({ r with _value: float(v: r._value) * 0.01 }))
  |> yield(name: "last")
```

```{seealso}
For more details on creating queries, see [InfluxDB's Flux documentation](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2/query-data/flux/).
```

### Adding a Visualization

First, a new dashboard needs to be created in Grafana by clicking on "Dashboards" and then "Create dashboard".
It should be noted that dashboards need to be saved manually, so it is recommend to directly save the new dashboard by
clicking "Save dashboard" in the top right corner, where a title for dashboard can be given.

In the top right corner new visualizations can be added. After selecting InfluxDB, the visualization panel editor opens
where the Flux query can be pasted:

```{figure} grafana_panel_editor.png
Grafana panel editor
```

To get a first view of the monitoring data, the query needs to be refreshed by clicking "Refresh" above the panel.
Left of the "Refresh" button, the time range can be adjusted. The panel can be further adjusted using the right side bar,
for example with a proper title, a unit (under "Standard options"), showing the last value (under "Legend" → "Values"),
adding a warning threshold, and not connecting values far apart ("Graph styles" → "Disconnected values"):

```{figure} grafana_panel_editor_final.png

```

Finally, the dashboard needs to be saved with the new panel. To automatically refresh the dashboard, the right triangle next
to the "Refresh" button in dashboard overview can be extended to select a refresh interval:

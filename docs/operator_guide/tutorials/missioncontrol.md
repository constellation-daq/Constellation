# Using MissionControl

MissionControl is a graphical Controller for Constellation. This tutorial demonstrates how to use MissionControl to control multiple
satellites, including initialization and taking data.

```{seealso}
It is recommend to read through the tutorial on how to [start and control a single satellite](single_satellite.md) first.
```

## Starting MissionControl

MissionControl is started using the `MissionControl` command or by searching for it in the application overview if
installed system-wide. On startup, the group name of the Constellation which should be controlled needs to be provided.

```{figure} qtgui_startup.png

```

```{hint}
Alternatively, MissionControl can be started with a group directly using the `-g GROUP` command line argument.
```

The main window of MissionControl can be divided into three parts:

- Information about the entire Constellation on top
- A section for controlling the entire Constellation
- A list of all connected satellites

```{figure} missioncontrol_empty.png

## Initializing the Constellation

In order to control satellites, some satellites need to be started as part of the same group. In this tutorial,
three `Sputnik` satellites named `One`, `Two` and `Three`, a `RandomTransmitter` named `Sender` and a `EudaqNativeWriter`
named `Receiver` are started.

```{note}
MissionControl does not start satellites. The five satellites required for this tutorial need to be started in a terminal as
shown in the [tutorial for a single satellite](single_satellite.md).
```

```{figure} missioncontrol_new.png

```

To initialize the satellites, the following configuration file is used:

```toml
[satellites.Sputnik]
interval = 3000

[satellites.Sputnik.One]
interval = 2500

[satellites.Sputnik.Two]

[satellites.RandomTransmitter.Sender]

[satellites.EudaqNativeWriter.Receiver]
_data_transmitters = ["Sender"]
output_directory = "/tmp/test"
```

```{important}
Make sure to create the output directory for the `EudaqNativeWriter`.
```

The configuration file can be selected with the {bdg-primary}`Select` button. Then, the satellites can be initialized using
the {bdg-primary}`Initialize` button. Once the button is clicked, a warning will appear that `Sputnik.Three` is not mentioned
explicitly in the configuration - this is a measure to prevent typing errors in configuration files. However in this case,
the initialization can be continued by clicking {bdg-primary}`Ok`.

```{hint}
Any satellites not explicitly mentioned will still be initialized. The configuration is generated from the global
`[satellites]` section and from the type specific section, e.g. `[satellites.Sputnik]`. If these do not exist, an empty
configuration is sent.
```

After the initializing, all satellites besides the `EudaqNativeWriter` are now in the {bdg-secondary}`INIT` state. The
initialization for the `EudaqNativeWriter` satellite failed, which resulted in the satellite being in the
{bdg-secondary}`ERROR` state.

Before moving on to rectifying this issue, it is worth taking a look at the top part of the window. Besides the information
about the group and number of connected satellites, there is also a state information. This includes the lowest state of all
satellites. If the state is "mixed", meaning that not all satellites have the same state, the lowest state is followed by "â‰Š".

```{seealso}
More details on the Constellation finite state machine and its different states and transitions can be found in the
[satellite chapter](../concepts/satellite.md#the-finite-state-machine).
```

```{figure} missioncontrol_init_first.png

```

The reason why the initialization of the `EudaqNativeWriter` failed becomes clear after checking its status, which is shown
in the "Last message" column of the satellites list, or its log messages either via the console output or a logging user
interface:

```{error}
Critical failure during transition: Value `[Sender]` of key `_data_transmitters` is not valid: `Sender` is not a valid canonical name
```

The `_data_transmitters` configuration parameter should contain the canonical names of all satellites from which the receiver
should receive data. The canonical name is `SATELLITE_TYPE.SATELLITE_NAME`, which in this case corresponds to
`RandomTransmitter.Sender`. In order to correct this and allow a successful initialization, the file should be adapted as follows:

```toml
[satellites.Sputnik]
interval = 3000

[satellites.Sputnik.One]
interval = 2500

[satellites.Sputnik.Two]

[satellites.Sputnik.Three]

[satellites.RandomTransmitter.Sender]

[satellites.EudaqNativeWriter.Receiver]
_data_transmitters = ["RandomTransmitter.Sender"]
output_directory = "/tmp/test"
```

```{hint}
MissionControl parses the file anew every time the configuration is requested - it is thus not required to select or reload the
same configuration file again.
```

With the amended configuration, all satellites can be initialized properly by clicking {bdg-primary}`Initialize` again.

```{tip}
Instead of initializing all satellites, it also possible to just initialize the particular satellite which went to {bdg-secondary}`ERROR` state.
More details on controlling single satellites are provided later in this tutorial in the section
[Controlling Individual Satellites](#controlling-individual-satellites).
```

## Recording Data

The next step is to start recording data. In order to do this, the satellites first need to be launched to the {bdg-secondary}`ORBIT`
state. In this state, the configuration send during the initialization is fully applied such that the satellites are ready
for immediate data taking. The satellites can be launched by clicking the {bdg-primary}`Launch` button.

```{figure} missioncontrol_orbit.png
MissionControl main window after launching
```

Data taking is organized in "runs": when data taking is started, a new run begins, and a run ends when data taking is
stopped. In Constellation, each run has a run identifier, a free-form string identifying this particular measurement.
In MissionControl, this run identifier is composed of two parts: a free-text identifier which can be provided in the control
section of the MissionControl window, and a run sequence counter which can be found next to the run identifier field.
This sequence number is automatically incremented every time a run ended. In the top right of the MissionControl window,
the current or next run identifier is shown.

```{seealso}
More information on Constellation data concepts, runs and their properties can be found in the [Data Processing section](../concepts/data.md) of this guide.
```

A new run can be started by clicking the {bdg-primary}`Start` button.

```{figure} missioncontrol_run.png
MissionControl main window in RUN state
```

After a run has started, the state switches to {bdg-secondary}`RUN` and the run duration timer in the top right starts counting the time the measurement is already running.
While data is being recorded, the controller can be closed without impact on the data taking since the satellites operate
autonomously. This allows closing and re-opening of user interfaces such as the controller without interrupting data taking
or even taking down the entire Constellation. When the controller is
restarted, the current run identifier as well as the run duration are retrieved from the Constellation automatically.

The run can be stopped by clicking the {bdg-primary}`Stop` button. Subsequently, the run sequence counter is incremented.
To shutdown the satellites or to change the configuration, the satellites need to be returned to the {bdg-secondary}`INIT`
state, which is done by clicking the {bdg-primary}`Land` button.

## Controlling Individual Satellites

With MissionControl it is also possible to control satellites individually when required. Commands to individual satellites can be sent by right-clicking on the respective satellite from list, and by picking the desired command from the context menu. The menu provides access to all commands that satellite offers, and also
allows to send custom commands which might not be publicly advertised by the satellite.

```{figure} missioncontrol_single_command.png
Sending a command to a single satellite
```

In this tutorial, the configuration of the `RandomTransmitter` satellite is retrieved from the running instance.
After the command is sent, a window appears containing the "payload" of the satellite response, which in this case is a
dictionary with the configuration. A satellite might also reply with a string, which is shown in the *last message* column of in the satellite list.

```{figure} missioncontrol_single_response.png

```

## Inspecting Satellite Details

To inspect details about a single satellite, for example its IP address, details can be shown by double-clicking on a
satellite in the list. A new window opens which contains some information about its connection. It also contains a list of
all available commands.

## Deducing the Configuration of the Constellation

Satellites are operating independently of any controller, and it is possible to start multiple controllers. This allows to
quickly check in on the Constellation without the need to access a specific computer. However, controllers do not necessarily have
access to the same configuration file. To alleviate this problem, the configuration of all satellites can be deduced from the
Constellation itself. This can be achieved by clicking the {bdg-primary}`Deduce` button.

For the Constellation started and configured in this tutorial, this will store a configuration file with the following content:

```toml
[satellites.sputnik.one]
interval = 2500

[satellites.sputnik.two]
interval = 3000

[satellites.sputnik.three]
interval = 3000

[satellites.randomtransmitter.sender]
_bor_timeout = 10
_data_timeout = 10
_eor_timeout = 10
frame_size = 1024
number_of_frames = 1
pregen = false
seed = 3641936878

[satellites.eudaqnativewriter.receiver]
_allow_overwriting = false
_data_transmitters = [ 'RandomTransmitter.Sender' ]
_eor_timeout = 10
flush_interval = 3
output_directory = '/tmp/test'
```

```{caution}
This configuration contains all parameters, including parameters with default values. While giving identical results during
initialization, it should not be seen as a replacement for the canonical configuration file which might be better grouped or
potentially contains important comments.
```

# Implementing a new Satellite in Python

This how-to guide will walk through the implementation of a new satellite, written in Python, step by step.
It is recommended to have a peek into the overall [concept of satellites](../concepts/satellite.md) in Constellation in
order to get an impression of which functionality of the application could fit into which state of the finite state machine.

```{note}
This how-to describes the procedure of implementing a new satellite for Constellation in Python. For C++ look [here](./satellite_cxx.md) and
for the microcontroller implementation, please refer to the [MicroSat project](https://gitlab.desy.de/constellation/microsat/).
```

## Implementing the FSM Transitions

In Constellation, actions such as device configuration and initialization are realized through so-called transitional states
which are entered by a command and exited as soon as their action is complete. A more detailed description on this can be found
in the [satellite section](../concepts/satellite.md) of the framework concepts overview. The actions attached to these
transitional states are implemented by overriding methods provided by the `Satellite` base class.

For a new satellite, the following transitional state actions **should be implemented**:

* `def do_initializing(self, config: Configuration)`
* `def do_launching(self, payload: any)`
* `def do_landing(self, payload: any)`
* `def do_starting(self, payload: any)`
* `def do_stopping(self, payload: any)`

The following transitional state actions are optional:

* `def do_interrupting(self)`: this is the transition to the `SAFE` state and defaults to `do_stopping` (if necessary because current state is `RUN`), followed by `do_landing`. If desired, this can be overwritten with a custom action.

For the steady state action for the `RUN` state, see below.

## Running and the Stop Event

The satellite's `RUN` state is governed by the `do_run` action, which - just as the transitional state actions above - is overridden from the `Satellite` base class.
The function will be called upon entering the `RUN` state (and after the `do_starting` action has completed) and is expected to finish as quickly as possible when the
`stop_running` Event is set. An example run loop is shown below:

```python
def do_run(self, payload: any) -> str:
    # the stop_running Event will be set from outside the thread when it is
    # time to close down.
    while not self._state_thread_evt.is_set():
        # Do work
    return "Finished acquisition."
```

Any finalization of the measurement run should be performed in the `do_stopping` action rather than at the end of the `do_run` function, if possible.

## Logging

Logging from a satellite can be done by using `self.log.LOG_LEVEL("Message")`, where possible log levels are `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, `critical`.
An example info level log message is shown below:

```python
self.log.info("Landing satellite; ramping down voltage")
```

The log messages are broadcast to listeners, and can be listened on by using e.g. `python -m constellation.core.monitoring`.

## Sending stats

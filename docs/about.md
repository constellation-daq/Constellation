# About Constellation

Constellation is an autonomous control and data acquisition system for small-scale experiments and experimental setup with volatile and dynamic constituents such as testbeam environments or laboratory test stands. Constellation aims to provide a flexible framework that is easy to use and requires minimal effort for the integration of new devices.

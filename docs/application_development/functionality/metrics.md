Metrics have to be registered before use. For satellite this can be done via:

```c++
register_metric("NAME", "unit", MetricsValue::LAST_VALUE, "description");
```

A metric can then be send using the `STAT` macros:

```c++
STAT("NAME", get_metric_value());
```

```{seealso}
There are also macros available to only send metrics every *nth* iteration or at most every *t* seconds. These macros are
described in detail in the [framework reference](../../framework_reference/cxx/core/metrics.md).
```

Metrics that are evaluated regularly from a lambda can also be registered:

```c++
register_timed_metric("NAME", "unit", MetricsValue::LAST_VALUE, "description", 10s,
                      [this]() -> std::optional<double> {
    return allowed_to_get_metric() ? std::optional(get_metric_value()) : std::nullopt;
});
```

The lambda can return either the value directly, or an optional, where the empty value means that the metric can currently
not be sent. To check if the satellite is in a given state the `getState()` method can be used, or the following helper:

```c++
register_timed_metric("NAME", "unit", MetricsValue::LAST_VALUE, "description", 10s,
                      {CSCP::State::ORBIT, CSCP::State::RUN},
                      [this]() { return get_metric_value(); }
);
```

Note that timed metrics can still be triggered manually if desired.

To send metrics (e.g. readings from a sensor), there are two approaches: one is
via a function decorator and the other is via a scheduling method.

The scheduling method,`schedule_metric`, makes it easy to create Metrics
programmatically at run time. This can be particularly useful in cases where you
only know e.g. the number of available channels after connecting to your
hardware device. The method takes a metric name, the unit, a polling interval, a
metric type and a callable function as arguments. The name of the metric will
always be converted to full caps.

* Metric type: can be `LAST_VALUE`, `ACCUMULATE`, `AVERAGE`, or `RATE`.
* Polling interval: a float value in seconds, indicating how often the metric is transmitted.
* Callable function: Should return a single value (of any type), and take no arguments. If you have a callable that requires
  arguments, consider using `functools.partial` to fill in the necessary information at scheduling time. If the callback
  returns `None`, no metric will be published.

An example call is shown below:

```python
self.schedule_metric("Current", "A", MetricsType.LAST_VALUE, 10, self.device.get_current)
```

In this example, the callable `self.device.get_current` fetches the current from
a power supply, is called every 10 seconds, and the value is sent as Metric with
name `Current`, unit `A` and an indicator for any receiver(s) to only show the
last value.

Similarly, you can arrange for a Metric to be sent via the `schedule_metric`
function decorator:

```python
@schedule_metric("A", MetricsType.LAST_VALUE, 10)
def Current(self) -> Any:
    if self.device.can_read_current():
        return self.device.get_current()
    return None
```

In case of the decorator, the name of the metric is taken from the function name. Again, if `None` is returned, no metric is sent.

If you are using class methods for retrieving values for your metrics, then the
decorator can be a convenient way of scheduling them. But if you need to create
Metrics at run time, then the method is a powerful approach to schedule an
arbitrary number of metrics.

```{attention}
Any registered Metrics are currently evaluated in any of the Satellite's states. This is in particular true for Metrics registered via the function decorator, as these can be executed even before the satellite is initialized.

This means that it is advisable to check for appropriate states within the function's body (e.g. `if not self.fsm.current_state_value in [SatelliteState.NEW, SatelliteState.ERROR]: ...`) and check the existence of a variable using `hasattr(self, "device")` first.

Should an error occur during the retrieval of a Metric, an error will be logged but the Satellite will not be affected otherwise and the Metric will be requested again at the next scheduled interval.

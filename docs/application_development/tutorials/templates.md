# Creating a New Satellite

Constellation provides [satellite templates](https://gitlab.desy.de/constellation/templates) for Python and for C++ with the
[Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) and [CMake](https://cmake.org/) build systems, which can be used as a starting point.

```{seealso}
This tutorial will create an external satellite. For more details on the difference between external and framework
satellites, consult the [introduction](../intro/listing.md).
```

## Getting Started

On GitHub, new repositories can be created from the template repositories using the green `Use this template` button.
For projects which will not be hosted on GitHub, the template code can be downloaded manually using the green `Code` button.

::::::{tab-set}
:::::{tab-item} C++
:sync: cxx

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Meson
:sync: meson

The template repository can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/constellation-daq/template-satellite-cpp-meson).

:::
:::{tab-item} CMake
:sync: cmake

The template repository can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/constellation-daq/template-satellite-cpp-cmake).

:::::
:::::{tab-item} Python
:sync: python

The template repository can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/constellation-daq/template-satellite-python).

After cloning the new repository, the first which should be done is adjusting the files to match the new
[satellite type](../../operator_guide/concepts/satellite.md#type-and-name). This can be easily done with the included
rename script:

```sh
./rename-template.py NewType
```

The rename script will adjust and rename all relevant files and finally deletes itself.

```{seealso}
Before committing the changes, it is recommended to install the provided pre-commit hooks as described in the
[introduction](../intro/tools.md#using-pre-commit).
```

## Installing Constellation

```{seealso}
The installation instructions in the [operator guide](../../operator_guide/get_started/install_from_source.md) can be
consulted to install build dependencies such as Meson or Python's `venv` module.
```

::::::{tab-set}
:::::{tab-item} C++
:sync: cxx

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Meson
:sync: meson

External satellites can use a [wrap file](https://mesonbuild.com/Wrap-dependency-system-manual.html) for Constellation to
automatically build Constellation if required. The Meson template satellite already contains a wrap file pointing to the
current version.

```{attention}
The wrap file does not automatically update when a new version is released. It is possible to updated it manually,
for example by downloading the current file from the template repository again.
```

Alternatively, Constellation can also be installed system-wide as explained in the instructions for CMake.

:::
:::{tab-item} CMake
:sync: cmake

External satellites require an installation from source of Constellation. By default, the `meson install` command installs to
`/usr/local`. This can be changed via:

```sh
meson configure build -Dprefix=CNSTLN_PREFIX # set installation directory here, e.g. `$(pwd)/usr`
meson install -C build
```

````{note}
Constellation exports its dependency using `pkg-config`, which can be easily used in many build systems, including CMake.
In order to find Constellation via `pkg-config` in a non-standard location when building external satellites, the prefix path
needs to be exported:

```sh
export CNSTLN_PREFIX=$(pwd)/usr
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$CNSTLN_PREFIX/lib64/pkgconfig:$CNSTLN_PREFIX/usr/share/pkgconfig"
```

Note that the platform specific part (`lib64`) might be different depending on your platform, e.g. it is
`lib/x86_64-linux-gnu` for `amd64` Debian/Ubuntu. It can be found be checking the content of the prefix path.
````

Constellation needs be installed in a virtual environment via pip, which will happen automatically using editable installs.

A virtual environment can be created via:

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Building the Satellite

::::::{tab-set}
:::::{tab-item} C++
:sync: cxx

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Meson
:sync: meson

The satellite can be built using:

```sh
meson setup build
meson compile -C build
```

:::
:::{tab-item} CMake
:sync: cmake

The satellite can be built using:

```sh
cmake -B build -G Ninja
ninja -C build
```

Or alternatively using Make:

```sh
cmake -B build
make -C build
```

:::::
:::::{tab-item} Python
:sync: python

The satellite can be installed in the virtual environment via:

```sh
pip install -e .
```

:::::

After building one can check that the satellite executable is working correctly:

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} C++
:sync: cxx

```sh
./build/SatelliteNewType
```

:::
:::{tab-item} Python
:sync: python

```sh
SatelliteNewType
```

:::

```{note}
`NewType` has to be replaced with the satellite type used when renaming.
```

## Implementing Functionality

There are separate implementation guides of the base functionality of a satellite for [C++](satellite_cxx.md) and
[Python](satellite_py.md). Separate guide exist for adding functionality such as [logging](../functionality/logging.md),
[metrics](../functionality/metrics.md), [data transmission](../functionality/data_transmission.md) and
[custom commands](../functionality/custom_commands.md).

Once the functionality has been implemented and tested, the README should be updated and included in the
[satellite listing](../intro/listing.md#listing-an-external-satellite-in-the-library).
If applicable, the satellite can also be added to the [main repository](../howtos/migrate_external_satellite.md).

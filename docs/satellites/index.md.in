# Constellation Satellite Library

These pages provide an overview of the satellites available for the Constellation framework.
Satellites from three different sources are listed here:

* Satellites without an icon are shipped together with the main Constellation framework. They are updated together with the framework, and their version number corresponds to that of the Constellation satellite library. These satellites typically come bundled with a Constellation installation.
* Satellites marked with "üì¶" are provided in their own Git repository. They are maintained by the Constellation main development team but receive updates separately from the core framework, and they need to be installed individually.
* Satellites marked with "üåê" are developed independently from the Constellation main development team. The satellite descriptions are generated from external sources which have been submitted for inclusion on these websites by their respective developers.

Detailed descriptions of how to implement new satellites in either C++ or Python can be found in [the application developer guide](../application_development/index).
Whether new satellites may be added to the main repository or should remain independent depends on a number of criteria, which are documented [here](../application_development/intro/listing).
